Building new instance for caMOD 2.3

1.  /local/content/evstree/tree_cache_files/ holds the cache files - folder structure was modified slightly
Move files to /app/content/ncicb-app/evstree/tree_cache_files/ on specified tier

2.  /local/content/camod/config/ holds camod.properties and mail.properties- folder now made and displays as /app/content/ncicb-app/camod/
Copy both files to the new folder structure on the specified tier
Modify the properties-service.xml to point to the current location of the properties files (add "/ncicb-app")

    <attribute name="Properties">
	gov.nih.nci.camod.camodProperties=/local/content/ncicb-app/camod/config/camod.properties
	gov.nih.nci.camod.mailProperties=/local/content/ncicb-app/camod/config/mail.properties   
	</attribute>    

3.  /usr/local/jboss-4.0.2/server/ncicb-app/deploy/ holds camod.war, EVSTree.war, oracle-ds.xml, and properties-service.xml
new location = /usr/local/jboss-4.0.5.GA/server/ncicb-app/deploy/

4.  /usr/local/jboss-4.0.2/server/ncicb-app/config holds login-config.xml
