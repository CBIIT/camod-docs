Dear Ulli Wagner,

This message refers to your recent request ID 24413:

Finding _Allele_key when querying by MGI number

Details:
Hi,
I would like to use the MGI Accession ID to query for the _Allele_key.
How can I accomplish this?
 
Thanks,
Ulli

Response Summary:
Finding _Allele_key when querying by MGI number

Details:
If you are trying to create links to MGI using the _Allele_keys, 
please see  How to Create WWW Links to MGI:
http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/other/link_instructions.shtml
Links to Allele Detail pages will be in this form:
Allele (MGI Accession ID)
http://www.informatics.jax.org/searches/accession_r
eport.cgi?id=MGI:1860962
Note that you may use the MGI ID in creating this link. There is no 
need to use the _Allele_key.
For your information, I will offer a hands-on workshop for both MGI 
users on Friday, March 31st.  Workshops will be held at the Center for
Information Technology (CIT) at 12:30 and 2:45. To enroll in a 
workshop, please see course #906 on the CIT's website:
http://training.cit.nih.gov/coursepicfull.asp?cnumber=906&term=06G
Please contact me with any questions, and feel free to forward my 
contact information to others who may benefit from workshop 
attendance.
----------------------------------
You can do this with direct SQL access to MGI, or by requesting a 
custom SQL report from our software engineers. Please see the database
reports page here:
ftp://ftp.informatics.jax.org/pub/reports/index.html#pheno
The code snippet that follows relates MGI Allele Accession IDs and 
_Allele_key to create the MGI_PhenotypicAllele.rpt file.
-----------------------------------
select s._Allele_key, a.accID
	from #alleles s, ACC_Accession a
	where s._Allele_key = a._Object_key
	and a._MGIType_key = 11 
	and a._LogicalDB_key = 1 
	and a.prefixPart = "MGI:"
	and a.preferred = 1
------------------------------------
The temporary table #alleles is formed by retrieving _Allele_key from 
the table ALL_Allele. You may view details of all tables in the schema
browser:
http://www.informatics.jax.org/schema/
Click on the table name in the menu beneath "189 matching user 
tables".
If you would like direct SQL access to MGI, please let me know and I 
will request a user name and password from our database administrator.
Alternatively, our software engineers can prepare a custom report 
containing all MGI Allele Accession IDs and _Allele_keys. Please be 
forewarned that this report may take several weeks to prepare. Please 
let me know which option you prefer.

--------------------------------------------
I hope this information is helpful to you.  Please contact us if you 
have additional questions or need further assistance with this matter.
 Please include the Request ID in the subject of your message if you 
send e-mail.  Thank you.

Sincerely,
