1) Duplicates in the taxon table. 
We decided to keep them for now, because it would be a difficult task to do the 
mapping when we delete the duplicates. This might be a task that could be 
done before the next release.

2) Look at enhancing the design for organ/disease table relations.

3) Add "Super User" functionality so that once person can modify all models.

4) Start infrastructure for check-in/unit testing

5) Remove unecessary cross-reference tables
