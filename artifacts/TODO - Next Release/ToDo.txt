1) Duplicates in the taxon table. 
We decided to keep them for now, because it would be a difficult task to do the 
mapping when we delete the duplicates. This might be a task that could be 
done before the next release.

2) Look at enhancing the design for organ/disease table relations.

3) Add "Super User" functionality so that once person can modify all models.

4) Start infrastructure for check-in/unit testing

5) Remove unecessary cross-reference tables

6) clean up field names? Example: The UID in the env_factor table is env_factor_id, 
   but the invivo_result and the screening_result tables still refer to it as agent_id. 
   
7) Refactor the Agent/EnvironmentalFactor tables.  A CarcionigenicIntervention is really not a Therapy.

8) Handle the Agent/Organ tables as lookup tables.  I.e. we can reuse the Agent/Organ, but create a 
   new one if it's not there.  It's too hard currently to map the data from the current DB, but
   it should be more straightforward to do that in the new schema.
