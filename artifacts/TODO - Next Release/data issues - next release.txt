1. resubmit models that have entries in current genetic background, this will boost the number of models and enable us to use correct nomenclature names

2. DTP yeast models and DTP xenograft models need to be displayed as models.
Xenograft models will have entries in the general information=model characteristics page and the xenograft 
page. We can add text in the experimental design field for all models. Text has to be identical for all models.

Yeast models will have entries in the general info=model characteristics page and the genetic description part.
This can be a bit tricky because we labeled the modifications as "IM"=induced mutations, but linked the yeast 
models to targeted modifications (table name is Yst_mod_Trgtd_Mod). 
Maybe we can fix this in the display.
