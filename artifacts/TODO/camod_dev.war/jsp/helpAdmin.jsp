                                            The screener performs the initial review of submitted models. This review is a quick check that all required fields have been specified and that the model does not contain junk or grossly inappropriate material. The screener also makes a preliminary assessment for clarity, typographic errors and other issues that would make the model less than fully comprehensible. The screening process should be complete within 24 hours.<br>
                                            The screener does not contact the submitter about the submission. Any deficiencies found are described in the email to the coordinator. Each email deals with only one submission, so that the emails can be independently routed for vetting.

                                            When the editor is notified that a model is ready for editing/reviewing, he or she examines the model to see if it satisfies criteria to be made available to the public. The editor also considers any comments made by the screener, which are passed along in the email from the coordinator. <br>
                                            The editor may determine that the model cannot be made acceptable for publication in the database. For example, the model may be a prank. If the model has correctable defects, it may be necessary to communicate by email with the submitter to make the model acceptable. Correspondence and telephone contact with the submitters may be conducted through the coordinator. Editors are responsible for maintaining a paper trail or log of email exchanges regarding the models they review.<br>
                                            The editor may elect to review a model without assistance. He or she can also request assistance from other subject matter experts. <br>
                                            Only the editor has the authority to release the model to the intended audience.
