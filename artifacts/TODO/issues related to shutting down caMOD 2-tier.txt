Sunset of caMOD 2-tier

1. The MMHCC repository website http://mouse.ncifcrf.gov contains links to specific models in caMOD 2-tier. The links are built using the modeluid of specific models. 
Example: The strain detail page for the Ink4a/arf knockout mouse http://mouse.ncifcrf.gov/available_details.asp?ID=01XB1 contains a link to caMOD: http://cancermodels.nci.nih.gov/mmhcc/searchResultsDetail.jsp?modelId=1636

We need to inform Dieter Naf (dnaf@ncifcrf.gov), Debbie Fitzgerald (dfitz@ncifcrf.gov), Kris Elspas (kxe@css.ncifcrf.gov) about the changes.




2. CMAP (Cancer Molecular Anatomy Project) http://cmap.nci.nih.gov
CMAP provides on its gene info pages links to caMOD data
Example: http://cmap.nci.nih.gov/Genes/GeneInfo?ORG=Mm&CID=222

If I remember correctly the data are provided by the cabioop database. Data from DATOP had been copied to cabioop a long time ago. Johnita worked on the pages. She would know best how the pages are populated. We need to discuss with the cabio / CMAP teams how to replace the data or how to build links in the caMOD n-tier data repository.






3. Emice website
The emice website contains links to specific queries in the mouse models part on the left menu bar. These links need to be replaced.
Example: http://emice.nci.nih.gov/mouse_models/organ_models/gastro_models  contains link to http://cancermodels.nci.nih.gov/mmhcc/Search?modelName=&PInames=&organTissueName=Gastrointestinal+Tract+(MMHCC)&organTissueCode=C18875396,C18875408,C18875413,C18875415,C18875418,C18875417,C18875416,C18875420,C18875414,C18875419,C18875409,C18875410,C18875412,C18875411,C18875397,C18875399,C18875400&SpeciesKey=&search=+++Search+++


Several pages in the emice mouse models part contain links to specific gene information. The URL contains http://cancermodels.nci.nih.gov  We need to check if we are going to break anything when we introduce the new application. 
Exampe: Emice page http://emice.nci.nih.gov/emice/mouse_models/organ_models/gastro_models/murine_intestinal_neoplasia/models_colorectal_cancer
contains this link http://cancermodels.nci.nih.gov/mmhcc/caBIO/GeneInfoContainer.jsp?LLID=16653


Under "Submissions" is a link to the caMOD submission page http://emice.nci.nih.gov/emice/submissions. Verify that the link will work after we switched to n-tier.



4. We should place a notification in the MMHCC newsletter. What newsletter would be best November? December?


5. Most website that link to caMOD 2-tier use this link http://cancermodels.nci.nih.gov/mmhcc/index.jsp   We need to make sure that we redirect from this link to the new app.

6. Fei needs to stop entering models at some point so that the "submitters" will have time to review his entries and declare their models to be complete. As long as he enters models he creates user accounts for the new "submitters" and the ystems group will need to create user accounts for them in CSM.
Another advantage of him stopping to enter models is that we can more easily compare numbers of model entries in DATOP and camoddev. This will help to verify the accuracy of the data mapping.

7. We should discuss blocking the submission a few weeks prior to the moving n-tier app in order to prevent the problems described in item
6 for Fei for all other users who submit models themselves. I am not sure if it would be acceptable to do this or if we rather run the data mapping
script a few more times after we put caMOD 2 in production. 

8. The screeners and editors need to be informed about the switch to the caMOD 2 and they need to receive training on how to use caMOD2.
