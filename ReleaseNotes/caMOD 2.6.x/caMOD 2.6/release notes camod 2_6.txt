    1.0 caMOD Version 2.6 Introduction and History 
================================================================ 
  
 
    caMOD 2.6, the Cancer Models Database, is a open source data management 
    system developed for the management and sharing of data of animal models. 
    caMOD features controlled vocabularies from a shared, publicly accessible metadata repository (caDSR) and enterprise vocabulary services (EVS) from the National 
    Cancer Institute..

BDA
The goal of the build and deployment automation (BDA) effort was to create a consistent and repeatable build and deployment process allowing each team to create production-ready software every day.  
Development teams spend time communicating, verifying and fixing various deployment environments. The environment creation process is manual, non-repeatable and slow. Automation will make it fast and cheap, 
therefore it will become part of their daily tasks. This will reduce time spent on non-development tasks and the DEV teams can better concentrate on creative development tasks.

Carcinogenic Interventions part expanded
New categories for Antibodies, Bacteria, Plasmid, Transposon, and Signaling Molecule were added to the carcinogenic interventions part. Users can now report exposure to bacteria and the utilization of the Sleeping Beauty system in caMOD. (GForge entry #23552)

The caMOD 2.5 Common Data Elements (CDEs) are available via caDSR

    4.0 Defects Fixed Since Last Release 
================================================================ 
 
- Display comments submitted to the transplantion page (GForge entry #24176)
- Delete orphaned disease records (GForge entry #23904)
- Display information stored in database when EVS does not return values (GForge entry #23751)
- Clean up microarray data table GForge entry #23551)
- Delete orphaned records in histopathology table (GForge entry #24379)

    5.0 Known Issues/Defects 
================================================================ 
     
    1. Organ-specific pre-selection of diagnoses in the vocabulary trees is 
       not available
    
    2. Genetic Description view screen does not include data for the following 
        sections: Libraries and Tissues (from EST data) or Protein Similarities 
        (from UniGene). caBio discontinued support for the Protein Similarities and 
        the performance for the Libraries and Tissues query did not meet minimum standards.  
        After meeting with the caBio team, it was concluded that the development team will need to eliminate lazy fetching for library and tissue attributes 
        if we want to improve performance.
     
    Please report any defects found to application support.
