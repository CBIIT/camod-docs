    1.0 - caMOD Version 2.3 Introduction and History
================================================================
 

    caMOD 2.3, the Cancer Models Database, is a open source data management 
    system developed for the management and sharing of data of animal models. 
    caMOD features controlled vocabularies from a shared, publicly accessible metadata 
    repository (caDSR) and enterprise vocabulary services (EVS) from the National 
    Cancer Institute.  caMOD database also features Application Programming 
    Interfaces (APIs) for programmatic access to the data.

    3.0 New Features and Updates
================================================================

Expanded EVS vocabulary support
- Render additional species-specific vocabularies (Rat anatomy, Diseases of Rats, Zebrafish anatomy, Zebrafish developmental stages, and staining methods) (gforge entry #6378, #6379, #4759, #4781))

Add functionality for submission and search of Zebrafish and Rat models:
- Link to zfin.org or to RGD (Rat Genome Database) for allele details on genetic description pages (gforge entry #6776)
- Link to zfin.org or to RGD (Rat Genome Database) for publication references (gforge entry #6774)
- Pages that use anatomy vocabulary trees need to show vocabularies depending on selected species (gforge entry #5897)
- Add drop down list for developmental stage to therapy page for zebrafish models (gforge entry #4796)
- Add "small molecules" to chemical class list on therapy submission page (gforge entry #4795)
- Add page for zin.org to model availability section (gforge entry #4794)
- Make diagnosis field on histopathology field free text and/or used Dr. Sabawaay's list for zebrafish models (gforge entry #4793)
- Add drop down list for delivery method to morpholino submission and search page (gforge entry #4792)
- Add drop down list for Target Site to morpholino submission and search page (gforge entry #4791)
- Add age drop down list to model characteristics submission and search page for zebrafish entries (gforge entry #4790)

Other
- Add conditioning regimen dropdown to xenograft page (gforge entry #4797)
- Make species drop down list on simple and advanced search a dynamic drop down list depending on what model species have approved records (gforge entry #6148)
- A new version of online help including a downloadable user guide (PDF file) has been updated. 

Administration
- Administration pages have additional filters

NCICB Technology Stack Requirements
- Upgrade to Jboss 4.0.5 from 4.0.2 
- Upgrade to newer version of ANT for project


The caMOD 2.1 Common Data Elements (CDEs) are available via caDSR 
(cancer Data Standard Repository) http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/core/caDSR
  
  
================================================================
    4.0 Defects Fixed Since Last Release
================================================================

Defect #5227: 	Customizing search results doesn't work when carcinogen is selected
Defect #5236: 	Fix Jax lab availability link and data - part 2	
Defect #5259: 	Adv search for carcinogens does not include data from Jackson Lab
Defect #5267: 	MTB radiation data are not shown
Defect #5284:  	Fix MGI link on genetic description pages and at the same time fix existing data
Defect #6269:   	Corrected concept codes for rat and zebrafish on existing models now that the new vocabularies are available from EVS
Defect #7099:   	Do not show human in species drop down list on model characteristics page
   

================================================================
    5.0 Known Issues/Defects
================================================================
    
    1. Organ-specific preselection of diagnoses in the vocabulary trees is 
       not available
    
    2. Users need to have a caArray user account in order to submit data to 
        caArray, users need to inform caMOD team if they would like to have 
        experiments in caArray linked to their caMOD entries
        
    3. Genetic Description view screen does not include data for the following 
        sections: Libraries and Tissues (from EST data) or Protein Similarities 
        (from UniGene). caBio discontinued support for the Protein Similarities and 
        the performance for the Libraries and Tissues query did not meet minimum standards.  
        After meeting with the caBio team, it was concluded that the development team 
        will need to eliminate lazy fetching forlibrary and tissue attributes 
        if we want to improve performance.
     
    Please report any defects found to application support.
