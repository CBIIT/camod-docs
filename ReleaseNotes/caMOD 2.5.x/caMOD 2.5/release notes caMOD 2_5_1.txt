    3.0 New Features and Updates
================================================================

- Grid
	* Programmatic access to caMOD is available through a caGRID data service (API). A data service allows data owners to share the 
	  data from a source (e.g. Oracle or MySQL relational databases) with their collaborators. caGRID is an infrastructure that connects 
	  data, research tools, scientists, and organizations to leverage their combined strengths and expertise in an open federated 
	  environment with widely accepted standards and shared tools.
		For more information about caGrid, see
		https://cabig.nci.nih.gov/workspaces/Architecture/caGrid. 

- Search 
	* Complete change of the search architecture to accomodate increased amount of data (GForge entry #5249, 16311, 16234)
	* Improved keyword search (GForge entries #16202, 15041)
	* Improved search for transgene and targeted modifications (GForge entry #15053)
	* Search for PubMed Identifier added to Advanced Search (GForge entry #11007)
	* Customization of the search results list improved (GForge entry #7474)
	
- Submission
	* Customization of publication submission page for rat model (GForge entry #9127)
	* Submission of URL for microarray experiments stored in locations other than caArray (GForge entry #5097)
	* Submission of URL for images stored in locations other than caIMAGE (GForge entry #7850)
	
- Other
	* New script improves data retrieval from PubMED (GForge entries #5173, 12064)


The caMOD 2.5 Common Data Elements (CDEs) are available via caDSR

- Left side search menu disappears when user customizes search result list, saves queries etc (GForge entry # 5204)
- Query not saved when search returns no models.(GForge entry # 7636)
- Drug screening search displays models that are not edited-approved (GForge #11697)
- Save query function broken (GForge #12042)
- Admin - View Model Assignment is not working (GForge entry #12108)
- Release date selection not maintaining value (GForge entry #12216)
- Dosage unit on Growth Factor page incorrectly stored and displayed (GForge entry #14332)

================================================================
    5.0 Known Issues/Defects
================================================================
    
    1. Organ-specific preselection of diagnoses in the vocabulary trees is 
       not available
    
    2. Users need to have a caArray user account in order to submit data to 
        caArray, users need to inform caMOD team if they would like to have 
        experiments in caArray linked to their caMOD entries
        
    3. Genetic Description view screen does not include data for the following 
        sections: Libraries and Tissues (from EST data) or Protein Similarities 
        (from UniGene). caBio discontinued support for the Protein Similarities and 
        the performance for the Libraries and Tissues query did not meet minimum standards.  
        After meeting with the caBio team, it was concluded that the development team will need to eliminate lazy fetching for library and tissue attributes 
        if we want to improve performance.
     
    Please report any defects found to application support.
