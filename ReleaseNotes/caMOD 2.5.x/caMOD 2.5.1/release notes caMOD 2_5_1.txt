    1.0 caMOD Version 2.5.1 Introduction and History
================================================================
 

    caMOD 2.5.1, the Cancer Models Database, is a open source data management 
    system developed for the management and sharing of data of animal models. 
    caMOD features controlled vocabularies from a shared, publicly accessible metadata repository (caDSR) and enterprise vocabulary services (EVS) from the National 
    Cancer Institute.

    3.0 New Features and Updates
================================================================

- EVS API upgrade
      *     The EVS (formerly part of caCORE ) API is a public domain, open source wrapper that provides 
            full access to the LexBIG Terminology Server. LexBIG hosts the NCI Thesaurus, the 
            NCI Metathesaurus, and several other vocabularies (like Zebrafish).
            
            The EVS 3.2 model, exposed as part of caCORE 3.2, has been re-released with
            LexBIG as the back-end terminology service in place of the proprietary Apelon DTS
            back end. The SDK 4.0 was used to generate the EVS 3.2 Java API, as well as the SOAP
            and HTTP REST interfaces.  The only difference between the EVS 3.2 API exposed as part of the caCORE EVS 4.x
            and the API exposed as part of caCORE 3.2 is the back-end terminology server used to
            retrieve the vocabulary data.             
            
            caMOD will upgrade to use the EVS 4.2 API to get the Display Name or Preferred Name for its
            vocabulary entries. 
             
            EVSTree has also been upgraded to retrieve all 8 vocabularies from the enw EVS 4.2 API. 

- caBIO API upgrade
      *     The caMOD application connects to caBIO to retrieve additional data for the Therapeutic Approaches 
            and Genetic Description search results screens.  On the Therapeutic Approaches search results screen caMOD 
            displays clinical trials data from caBIO.  On the Genetic Description search results screen caMOD displays 
            additional data within the Targeted Modification section for "Gene Info" (official nomenclature of the gene), 
            Database Links to UniGene and CGAP, "Gene Ontology" (controlled vocabulary to describe gene and gene product attributes), 
            and "BioCarta Pathways".  

            caMOD will upgrade to use the caBIO 4.0 API (jars match EVS 4.2) to get additional data from caBIO.

    4.0 Defects Fixed Since Last Release
================================================================

GForge entry #5172	Do not delete EnvironmentalFactor objects - instead reuse and leave in DB

GForge entry #11623	Construct sequence field on genetic description screens are independent of image submission
GForge entry #12483	Why does unpublished entry not show up on publication, cell lines, or therapeutic approaches search screen
GForge entry #17320	Make sure all field sizes in database are validated correctly in validation.xml
GForge entry #17833	Make sure all references to Transplantation are properly named

GForge entry #21636	Validation too stringent on image page for existing models
GForge entry #21637	Transplant search and submission pages do not display human organs

    5.0 Known Issues/Defects
================================================================
    
    1. Organ-specific preselection of diagnoses in the vocabulary trees is 
       not available
    
    2. Genetic Description view screen does not include data for the following 
        sections: Libraries and Tissues (from EST data) or Protein Similarities 
        (from UniGene). caBio discontinued support for the Protein Similarities and 
        the performance for the Libraries and Tissues query did not meet minimum standards.  
        After meeting with the caBio team, it was concluded that the development team will need to eliminate lazy fetching for library and tissue attributes 
        if we want to improve performance.
     
    Please report any defects found to application support.
