TO BUILD CODE
open putty - run putty.exe file

open connection to: cbiodev104

login:  jboss-camod
password:  jboss#c@m

at prompt type: cd /local/home/jboss4b/caMOD  (capitalize MOD)
at prompt type: ./build.sh
OR: . build.sh (until we get execute rights on the file)

The script will pull all code from CVS and build it.

TO DEPLOY CODE
When done type: cd camod_dev/build
type: pwd

This lists the directory you are working from.  Highlight the path to use 
later.  No need to explicitly copy since Unix will remember it automatically.

type: cd [Return]
This gets you out of the CVS directory(?)

type:  cd deploy [Return]

type:  cp [hit both left and right mouse button] 

You will see:  cp /local/home/jboss4b/caMOD/camod_dev/build
add:  /camod.war .  
complete command: cp /local/home/jboss4b/caMOD/camod_dev/build/camod.war . 
** need "space ." at end **

This will copy (cp) the camod.war file into the development deploy folder.

this is the deployment folder for the dev server (?):
/usr/local/jboss402/server/ncicb-app/deploy

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Stop/start server in 

cd ~
cd bin
type:   . stop_jboss
wait for 2-4 minutes / check for process list??

type:   . start_jboss
