How to update Online Help files

1.  Find zip file under L:\Technical Writing\For Sima (or wherever they were put) 
2.  Unzip to a location of your choice
3.  The output files are under "caMOD Online Help\caMOD Online Help\Output\WebWorks Help 5.0\caMOD" (providing the folder was called "caMOD Online Help."
4.  Completely replace all the files under this folder into the project (i.e. rename the final folder under "caMOD Online Help\Output\WebWorks Help 5.0" to caMOD
 and copy paste into project for caMOD to work)
Note:  Do not copy all the parent folders that are worthless in the project

5.  GO to ContextSensitiveHelp.properties and replace the context with the new context name from from context.js (i.e. context=caMOD_2.2_OH needs to be "caMOD_Online_Help")
Note:  In the future this context should stay the same
