download putty - Free secure shell application

TO BUILD CODE
open putty - run putty.exe file

open connection to: cbiodev104

login:  jboss-camod
password:  jboss#c@m

at prompt type: cd /local/home/jboss4b/caMOD  (capitalize MOD)
at prompt type: ./build.sh
OR: . build.sh (until we get execute rights on the file)



***************Modified build.sh to complete all steps below******************
***Left steps for reference**

The script will pull all code from CVS and build it.

TO DEPLOY CODE
When done type: cd camod_dev/build
type: pwd

This lists the directory you are working from.  Highlight the path to use 
later.  No need to explicitly copy since Unix will remember it automatically.

type: cd [Return]
This gets you out of the CVS directory(?)

type:  cd deploy [Return]

type:  cp [hit both left and right mouse button] 

You will see:  cp /local/home/jboss4b/caMOD/camod_dev/build
add:  /camod.war .  
complete command: cp /local/home/jboss4b/caMOD/camod/build/camod.war . 
** need "space ." at end **

// Added these commands the build.sh so the war is moved to the correct directory automatically
cd /usr/local/jboss-4.0.2/server/ncicb-app/deploy/
cp /local/home/jboss4b/caMOD/camod/build/camod.war .

This will copy (cp) the camod.war file into the development deploy folder.

this is the deployment folder for the dev server (?):
/usr/local/jboss402/server/ncicb-app/deploy

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Stop/start server in 

cd ~
cd bin
type:   . stop_jboss
wait for 2-4 minutes / check for process list??

type:   . start_jboss


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Unix SYNTAX

cp [-i] [-r] oldfiles directory[/newfiles]

-i Prompts you before replacing a file. 
-r When a directory is copied it copies the subdirectories within the directory and creates the directories if they do not exist. 
oldfiles The file that you want to copy. 
directory The name to give to a new copy. 
newfiles The directory of were the new files are going to be. 

Unix EXAMPLE
cp file1.txt newdir - Copies the file1.txt to the newdir directory. 

To get a list of files in a directory with the date stamp - i.e. check for a new camod.war:
ls -l 

//edit build.sh
vi build.sh   
move only with arrows
using the "x" characters deletes the char under the cursor
// save edits:
":wq"  needs colon

//Show overview on the "rm" command - use any of the commands 
man rm 

----------------------Tricks (short cuts) ------------------
Tip 1.  At any point, you can run the below commands to determine who you are within the shell:

$ id
$ whoami

Tip 2.  NOTE: Occasionally there are issues w/ changes to JSP pages not being updated to the newest version.  To fix this, you must remove the camod directory under
~work/jboss.web/localhost.  I.e.

	cd ~/work/jboss.web/localhost
	rm –Rf camod

	And then redeploy the application 
	
Tip 3.  You can change the overall permissions for the group file by executing the following command

 “chmod 644 server.log” from the role account (also from the folder with server.log).  This will give everyone read access to the log file. 
 You can change the file name to get access to other files.
