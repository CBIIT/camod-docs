Using Eclipse to download the Subversion repository of caMOD

Step 1
Install Eclipse Subclipse plugin
( Subclipse homepage with installation guide: http://subclipse.tigris.org/install.html )

In Eclipse
Help > Software Updates > Find and Install

Depending on your version of Eclipse

   Name: Subclipse 1.4.x (Eclipse 3.2+)
   URL:  http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.4.x

   Name: Subclipse 1.2.x (Eclipse 3.2+)
   URL:  http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.2.x
   
   Name: Subclipse 1.0.x (Eclipse 3.0/3.1)
   URL:  http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.0.x

Follow steps to finish installation of subclipse

Step 2
Create a new Subversion project and retrieve files from SVN

File > New > Project

Select
SVN > Checkout Projects from SVN

Create a new repository location
URL: https://gforge.nci.nih.gov/svnroot/camod
Select the trunk then camod

Note: These are all the parameters required to get the repository
Name the project and select a workspace
Click Finish

Sync'ing and committing to the repository is almost exactly identical to how it is done in CVS.
When committing files, subclipse will ask you for your username and password.

Past converting current CVS repo to Subversion repo email trail

Hi Nick,
The migration has been completed, and the accounts have been synched. The SVN location is at https://gforge.nci.nih.gov/svnroot/camod/

Since you mentioned that you and your team is not ready to move completely yet, let me know when you would like the GForge SCM tab to be pointing to the new repository.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Hi Nick,
We received your request to convert your project to Subversion.  We normally schedule a time in advance to do the conversion.

During that time period we ask that no one on your team make any commits or updates to the CVS repository.

Does the 8-10am time frame on Wednesday or Thursday work for you and your team?
Just let me know.
Thanks,

My Orginal Email

The caMOD team would like to request that our project be COPIED (not
moved) from our CVS to a new subversion project with the same name (camod).

IMPORTANT NOTE: It is very important that our current CVS project remain
intact and unmodified as we will still require it for our development.

caMOD CVS project location
Host: cbiocvs2.nci.nih.gov
Repository Path: /share/content/gforge/camod

Notify us with any further details you require.

Please provide us with all the necessary login and subversion location
information when completed.
