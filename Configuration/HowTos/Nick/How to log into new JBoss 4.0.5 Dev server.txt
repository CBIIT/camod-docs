How to log into new JBoss 4.0.5 Dev server

Use filezilla to see directory folders, get server.log, move wars to tmp folder, ect - But must use putty.exe to copy wars to the deploy folder (need to be in superuser account).

1. log into cbiovdev5058.nci.nih.gov
username: pandyas
password: caFun!0

2.  to change to the super user account
type: "su - jboss45a"
password = caFun!0

This account lets you copy the war from the tmp folder to the deploy folder.  Can't move wars directly to deploy folder.
