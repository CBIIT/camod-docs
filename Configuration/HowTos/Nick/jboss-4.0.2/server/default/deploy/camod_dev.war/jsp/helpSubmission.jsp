				<LI><B>Model Descriptor</B><BR>Model descriptor is the commonly used name for the model. The model descriptor is like a &quot;nick name&quot; for the model (e.g. conditional BrCa1 knockout).<BR>In some cases the model name might be the same as the genotype (e.g. Wap-Cre).<BR>The program accepts multiple models with the same name (like Melanoma model). The record is identified by an unique number and not by the name. The search 
      will eventually pull up all records that match certain criteria.
	  			<LI><B>PI's Email Address:</B><BR> Please enter the email address of the Principal Investigator, if none is available, enter "none".
				<LI><B>Species</B><BR>Select the species from the drop-down list. The list contains Mouse (Mus musculus), Rat (Rattus rattus) and Rat (Rattus norvegicus). If you use an animal that is not listed please contact the <A href="#1-5"><B>help desk</B></A> immediately so that we can add the species.
				<LI><B>Phenotype</B><BR>The field &quot;Phenotype&quot; asks for a general description of the phenotype.<BR>Example: Expression of the SV40 early region in the mammary and prostate 
        epithelium leads to invasive carcinoma development over a predictable 
        time course. The transgene is expressed in mammary ductal cells and the 
        terminal ductal lobular unit in virgin animals and without hormone stimulation.
				<LI><B>Record Release Date</B><BR>You can choose between:<BR>Option 1: The record will be shown immediately.<BR>Option 2: The record will be shown after a specified date. Select the date from the calendar that pops up when you select the radio button.<BR>We will contact the submitter of the record about a week prior to the release date and 
        confirm the date. If we do not receive a response from the submitter the 
        record will not be displayed.

				<LI><B>Experimental Design</B><BR>The experimental design describes how a model was generated. This is especially 
        important for GEM.<BR>Example: &quot;The 4.5 kb 5' flanking region of the C3(1) component of rat 
        prostatein was utilized to target expression for SV40 Tag to the prostate 
        epithelium.&quot;<BR>

				<LI><B>Sex Distribution</B><BR>Select from the drop-down list if the phenotype occurred in one of the sexes or in both genders.
				<LI><B>Breeding Notes</B><BR>Enter information about breeding problems or other issues related to the breeding of this model, e.g. infertility in males. Information about homo- or heterozygosity may also be stored in this field. This information is especially valuable when the strain is kept  heterozygous, but the phenotype occurs only in homozygous mice.

        Strains - Genetically Engineered Mutant Mice</A></P>
<P><B>Nomenclature for Genetically Engineered Mice</B><BR>Transgenes formerly began with the <B>genetic background</B> followed by the <B>mode of incorporation</B> (TgN for nonhomologous insertion, TgR for insertion via infection with a retroviral vector, and TgH for homologous recombination), followed by <B>designation for the DNA insert</B> (most often the gene symbol with or without an indication of the promoter), a <B>number indicating the founder line</B>,  and a <B>laboratory registration 
        code</B>. For example, the transgenic strain C57BL/6-TgN(APOA1)1Rub is on a C57BL/6 
        genetic background with the human <i>APOA1</i> gene (human gene symbols are designated 
        by italicized capital letters) incorporated into the mouse genome by nonhomologous 
        insertion (pronuclear injection of DNA). The founder number is &quot;1&quot; and 
        the mutation was made by Dr. E.M. Rubin (lab registration code Rub).
		
		<BR><BR>

		In January, 2001, the International Committee on Standardized Genetic Nomenclature for Mice decided that transgenic alleles will be in the following 
        format:
<BR>o Tg denoting transgene
<BR>o In parentheses, the official gene symbol of the inserted DNA
<BR>o The laboratory's line or founder designation or a serial number
<BR>o The Lab Code of the originating lab <br>
For example, Tg(Zfp38)D1Htz is a transgene containing the mouse <i>Zfp38</i> gene, in line D1 reported by Nathaniel Heintz.<BR>In this catalog we have not changed existing names but have used the new nomenclature rules for all new strains.

<BR><BR>
<B>Chemically induced and targeted mutations</B> follow the same guidelines 
        as described for mice with spontaneous mutations (see next paragraph). 
        Alleles are designated by the chemical mutagen or by the abbreviation 
        &quot;tm&quot; (targeted mutation) followed by a number and the laboratory registration code and are superscripted to the gene symbol (e.g., <i>Apoa1 <sup>tm1Unc</sup></i> ). Please 
        note, for space reasons the allele designation (tm# lab code) has been 
        deleted from the SYMBOL column in this catalog.</P>

		
<P><B>Nomenclature for Mice with Spontaneous Mutations</B>

<BR>Gene symbols are an abbreviation of the gene name and are set in italics. 
        Symbols for recessive genes always begin with a lower case letter. All 
        other symbols (for dominant, semi-dominant, or co-dominant genes) begin 
        with an uppercase letter followed by lower case letters. For mutant genes, 
        the gene and first mutant allele symbol are the same until the gene is 
        cloned (see <i>Nomenclature for Cloned Mutations</i> below). Different alleles 
        of a gene may be represented by a superscript to the gene symbol. Strain 
        names for mice carrying spontaneous mutations are designated in one of 
        the following three ways:<BR><BR><B>Example 1:</B> C57BL/6J-A <sup><i>w-J</i></sup><BR>Description: When a mutation is maintained on an inbred strain background 
        by mating homozygotes together, the gene symbol is given once. All offspring 
        from this mating are affected mutant mice (phenotypically manifest the 
        genetic mutation).<BR><BR><B>Example 2:</B> C57BL/6J-<i>Ghrhr<sup>lit</sup> </i>/+<BR>Description: When a mutation is maintained on an inbred strain background 
        by brother x sister matings with forced heterozygosis, the gene symbol 
        is followed by the designation: /+. In the case of a recessive mutation, 
        25% of the offspring are affected if the strain is maintained by intercrossing 
        heterozygotes and 50% are affected if it is maintained by mating heterozygotes 
        to homozygotes. 50% of the offspring are affected if the mutant gene is 
        transmitted dominantly or semidominantly.<BR><BR><B>Example 3:</B> B6.Cg-<i>ax <sup>J</sup></i> or B6C3Fe-<i>a/a-Csf1 <sup>op</sup></i><BR>Description: When the strain is maintained by continued backcrossing to 
        an inbred strain or F1 hybrid, the symbol(s) for the introduced gene(s) 
        is given once. Progeny from strains maintained by backcrossing to F1 hybrids 
        are not true F1's and are segregating at all genes for which the F1 parental 
        strains differ.
		
		<BR><BR><B>Nomenclature for Cloned Mutations</B><BR>During 1994, the <i>International Committee on Standardized Genetic Nomenclature 
        for Mice</i> voted to change the symbols of mutations that have been cloned 
        to show they are mutant alleles of the cloned genes. The mutation's symbol 
        is changed by superscripting the mutation symbol to the cloned gene symbol. 
        For example, the <i>shi</i> (shiverer) mutation in the <i>Mbp</i> (myelin basic protein) 
        gene became <i>Mbp <sup>shi</sup></i> . If the original mutation symbol already has a superscript, 
        the mutation and allele superscript symbols are placed on one line in 
        the new superscript and hyphenated, e.g., the <i>shi <sup>mld</sup></i> (myelin deficient) 
        mutation becomes <i>Mbp <sup>shi-mld</sup></i> . When a mutation is shown to occur in a 
        cloned candidate gene, the first letter of the gene symbol may remain 
        uppercase and the inheritance pattern may be conveyed in the allele symbol, 
        e.g., the <i>e</i> (recessive yellow) and<i> E <sup>so</sup></i> (sombre) alleles at the <i>Mc1r</i> (melanocortin 
        1 receptor) gene become <i>Mc1r <sup>e</sup></i> and <i>Mc1r <sup>E-so</sup></i> . Note that mutant allele 
        names will stay the same. For a complete listing of nomenclature rules and guidelines see <a href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/nomen/table.html" target="_blank">www.informatics.jax.org/nomen/table.html</a>

<BR><BR><B>Nomenclature for Coat Color Markers</B>

<BR>Some strains are maintained by using coat color markers (e.g., strains 
        carrying the diabetes mutation such as C57BLKS/J-<i>m +/+ Lepr <sup>db</sup></i>). <i>Lepr 
        <sup>db</sup></i> is maintained in repulsion with the closely linked marker misty, <i>m</i>, 
        a coat color gene;&nbsp;<i>m +/+ Lepr <sup>db</sup> x m +/+ Lepr 
        <sup>db</sup> </i>, produces three genotypes all of which are phenotypically distinguishable. 
        The + <i>Lepr <sup>db</sup></i> /+ <i>Lepr <sup>db</sup></i> mice are fat and black, the <i>m</i> +/+ <i>Lepr <sup>db</sup></i> mice 
        are lean and black, and the <i>m</i> +/<i>m</i> + mice are lean and misty (dark gray).


<BR><BR><B>Nomenclature for Congenic Strains</B>
<BR>Congenic strains are designated by a compound symbol consisting of the 
        host strain designation separated by a period from the donor strain and 
        followed by a hyphen and the symbol of the differential locus or loci 
        and allele(s) in italics, e.g., B10.129P-<i>H12 <sup>b</sup></i> . Abbreviated strain symbols 
        are most often used to shorten the strain name. In cases where the donor 
        strain is not an inbred or is complex, the symbol Cg, denoting congenic, 
        is used. Strains assume congenic nomenclature after five generations 
        of backcrossing and are considered incipient congenics until the tenth 
        generation is reached. The generation number is included in the strain 
        detail to help distinguish incipient congenic strains from full congenic 
        strains. The Jackson Laboratory supplies a large number of histocompatibility 
        congenic strains. In some cases, multiple lines were derived from the 
        same donor strain and are distinguished by a number and/or letter in parentheses; 
        e.g., B10.129P-<i>H11 <sup>b</sup></i> (10M)/Sn and B10.129P-<i>H46 <sup>b </sup>H47 <sup>b</sup></i> (21M)/Sn.</P>
