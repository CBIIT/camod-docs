Upload any changes when you get it working.  Sorry I didn't have time to fix my local instance after this build.

9.  We are still using Oracle 9i so you may have this installed on you computer still.  Since we upgraded to use JNDI you will automatically connect to the camoddev22 database defined in the hibernate-cf.xml as "java:camod: which gets its database parameters from the oracle-ds.xml file.  There are no longer tier specific camod.properties files in the project.  There is also not a way to hard code a connection to a local database unless you insist and want to define it in your local oracle-ds.xml file.  It is easier to develop on the dev tier directly now.

10. Compare your tnsnames entries for dev, qa, and stage tier

11. Usernames and passwords for all database tiers are stored in T:\camod\General\
