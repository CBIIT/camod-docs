Here are the queries
1. I create jackson lab tmp2 and work off that to generate the abs cancer model

2. Here is the query for jacksonlabtmp2

select DISTINCT a.TUMORKEY, a.TUMORNAME, TO_CHAR(a.TUMORSYNONYMS), a.STRAINKEY, 
a.STRAINNAME, a.STRAINTYPES, a.STRAINGENERALNOTE, d.AGENTTYPE, d.AGENTNAME, a 
.ORGANKEY, a.ORGANAFFECTED, c.METASTASISORGAN, c.METASTASISKEY, a.SEX, 
a.REPRODUCTIVESTATUS, a.TUMORFREQUENCY, a.AGEOFONSET, a.AGEOFDETECTION, 
e.JNUM_COMBINED,
to_char(a.STRAINSYNONYMS) from ZSTG_TUMOR a, ZSTG_TUMOR_REFERENCE_COMBINED b, 
ZSTG_METASTASES_COMBINED c, ZSTG_TUMOR_AGENTNAME_COMBINED d, 
ZSTG_TUMOR_REFERENCE_COMBINED e where a.TUMORKEY = d.TUMORKEY(+) and a.TUMORKEY 
= c.TUMORKEY(+) and a.TUMORKEY = b.TUMORKEY(+) and a.TUMORKEY = e.TUMORKEY(+);


3. Here's the query for abscancermodel. 

(select nvl(X.STRAIN_NAME,' ') as strain, 'Strain Type: '||nvl(to_char(
replace(x.STRAIN_TYPES, '|', ' & '))||'<br>Notes: '||to_char(X.STRAIN_GENERAL_NO
TE)||'<br>Strain Synonyms: '||to_char(replace(to_char(X.STRAIN_SYNONYMS), '|', '
&nbsp;•&nbsp;')),' ') as experimentdesign,
X.smallestTumorKey, nvl(X.strainkey,' '), nvl(to_char(X.strain_synonyms),' ') as
 strainynonyms, nvl(X.strain_types,' '), nvl(to_char(X.strain_general_note),' ')
, nvl(X.treatment_type,' '), nvl(X.treatment_agents,' ') 
from
(
 select DISTINCT a.STRAIN_KEY as strainkey,
 a.STRAIN_NAME, a.STRAIN_TYPES, a.STRAIN_GENERAL_NOTE,
 a.TREATMENT_TYPE, a.TREATMENT_AGENTS,
 to_char(a.STRAIN_SYNONYMS) as STRAIN_SYNONYMS,
 min(a.MTB_ID) as smallestTumorKey
 from
 JACKSON_LAB_TMP2 a
 group by a.STRAIN_NAME, a.STRAIN_KEY,
 a.STRAIN_TYPES, a.STRAIN_GENERAL_NOTE,to_char(a.STRAIN_SYNONYMS), a.TREATMENT_TYPE, 
a.TREATMENT_AGENTS) X); 


Before the abscancermodels are extracted, the following is done
1. Env Factor is loaded with data from zstg_agent (Note that due to trailing whitespace issues, a new 
column agentnametrimmed has been added to zstg_agent with *agentnametrimmed* being loaded into 
EnvFactor)
2. Once the above query runs, the treatmentagent and treatmenttypes are looked up in EnvFactor to 
create an entry in CarcinogenExposure for most agent types. (Agents of type "None Spontaneous" are 
not included in CarcinogenExposure)
3. Entries are created in Nomenclature unique on strain and abscancermodelid

Let me know if you need anything else.
Thanks
Lalitha

Hi Lalitha,

I did a quick check on the number of models created by the MTB data load. There are now 5189 MTB 
models instead of the 5010 that we had so far.  

 

select count (abs_cancer_model_id) from abs_cancer_model where external_source = 'Jax MTB' and 
state = 'Edited-approved'

 

Can you please send me the SQL that you use to determine how many entries go in the 
abs_cancer_model table (distinct combination of strainkey, strainname, straingeneralnote, straintypes, 
agenttype, agentname taking into consideration that some tumorkeys are associated with agents and 
others are not). I would like to find out if 5010 or 5189 is the correct number of abs_cancer_models.

 

Thanks,

 

Ulli

I reran the load and the test scripts you provided, successfully. 

 

Let me know if you find anything unusual.

 

Thanks
