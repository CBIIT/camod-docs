    1.0 - caMOD Introduction and History
================================================================
 

    caMOD, the Cancer Models Database, is a open source data management
    system developed for the management and sharing of data of animal models.
    caMOD features controlled vocabularies from a shared, publicly accessible 
    metadata repository (caDSR) and enterprise vocabulary services (EVS)
    from the National Cancer Institute.  caMOD database also features 
    Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for programmatic access 
    to the data.

================================================================

New Features in caMOD 2.1
----------------------------------------------------------------

General
- Integration of tumor models from Jackson laboratories tumor biology database: 
  caMOD provides access to tumor models in the MTB database. Basic information 
  about the tumor models from MTB are provided in the model characteristics, genetic
  description and histopathology pages and are identified with the Jax logo
  in each of the display pages as well as the initial search hit lit. Hyperlinks
  allow users to directly view detailed information about those models in
  MTB database.

- The caMOD API architecture provides the ability for accessing and retrieving 
  caMOD data via several mechanisms.  The design provides functionality enabling 
  remote applications to query and retrieve caMOD domain data using caCore and 
  caGrid based methodologies, in addition to providing the necessary infrastructure 
  for the integration of caMOD into the caBIG Index Service.

  For mre information, please refer to 
  caMOD 2.1 Remote API Reference Guide
  caGrid 0.5 Technical Guide

- Utilization of NCI Thesaurus: Cancer models database leverages caBIO 3.1 API to
  selectively restrict the list of diagonis based upon an organ selection. The new
  EVS Tree implementation makes use of the roles/relationship 
  (e.g EO_Disease_Has_Associated_EO_Anatomy) to derive the list of applicable diseases
  for the selected organ.

- caMOD now uses the secure http protocol during the login procedure when the 
  username and password is entered and submitted to the browser. After successful
  authentication, the application will revert back to "regular http" for any
  subsequent web transactions not requiring transmission of secure information
  such as user_id/password.

Search

- caMOD 2.1 release provides the ability to save user’s queries and last 
  execution date and time, and retrieve the queries at user’s request. The 
  Search Results page allows users to save the query that generated the 
  displayed results.  

- In this new release, users will be able to retrieve 25 previously executed queries at 
  any time for re-execution. Links will be provided in the left side navigation 
  to give the user access to the View Saved Queries and View Query History pages.

- Recalling a user’s most recent query from previous site visits. The query can 
  be saved and/or executed Informing the user about new changes and new data 
  available. The View Query History page displays a table of the last twenty (25)
  queries that the user executed. This includes any execution of a query, 
  including both queries that are not saved and saved queries that are 
  resubmitted.

- The Manage Saved Queries page is a new page that is accessed by clicking 
  the “View Saved Queries” link in the side navigation bar.  The page displays 
  a table of all queries that are currently saved for the user, and provides
  the user the ability to change query/filter parameters.

- caMOD release 2.1 allows users to configure the results table (hit list). 
  Users will be able to customize the columns, order and the number of items
  they would like to retreive in a page.

New Feature in caMOD release 2.0
----------------------------------------------------------------

caMOD 2.0 is a caBIG Silver level compliant application. For caBIG compatibility information see http://https://cabig.nci.nih.gov/guidelines_documentation

The caMOD Common Data Elements (CDEs) are available via caDSR (cancer Data Standard Repository)
http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/core/caDSR

General
- Utilization of NCI Thesaurus
- Utilization of the Common Security Module (CSM) for user authentication

Submission

After the user logs in the submission his/her previously entered models and models records in which he/she is listed a Principal Investigator are listed.

- Model Characteristics: 
	The scope of the cancer models database was expanded to include tool mice. Tool mice or tool animals are strains that can be used to generate cancer models and do normally not develop tumors. Tool mice are commonly used to generate conditional knock out animals. 
	Examples for tool strains are Cre-expressing strains or strains that carry one or more floxed genes. 


- Genetic Description 
	A field was added to all pages in this part of the application to allow the submitter to enter the MGI (Mouse Genome Informatics) identifier which will enable the retrieval of additional information from the informatics resources at the Jackson Laboratory.

	The Targeted Modification page and the induced mutation page allow the user to enter the Gene Entrez ID for the affected gene. This will enable us to provide users with additional information about the gene(s).

	Induced mutation contains a field for Gene Entrez ID for the affected gene. If a chemical triggered the mutation the user has the option to enter the CAS number for the chemical that was used.

	A submission page for Spontaneous Mutation was added.

	The submission pages for induced and spontaneous mutation contain fields to gather information about the genetic changes that occurred in the models as well as the methods of observation with which these changes were detected.


- Carcinogenic Intervention
	A page for entering information on Gene Delivery was added to this part of the application. Gene deliveries are done by viruses that carry a gene. 
	All pages of the carcinogenic interventions part were updated to include fields for gender, age at treatment, and administrative route (if applicable). The Chemical / Drug page allows the user to enter the NSC and/or CAS number of the chemical used in this experiment. 


- Publication
	The user is asked to indicate if a particular publication the existence of the animal model was reported for the first time. Eventually this feature will be used to link to records in the Mouse Tumor Biology Database at the Jackson Laboratory. 


- Histopathology
	Users can submit information about clinical markers and their values that were found in or are associated with specific tumor types.
	A field for describing the methods of observation / detection of genetic changes in the tumors was added. 
	Users can enter data found in other species in particular humans in the “Comparative Data” field.


- Cell lines

- Therapeutic Approaches
	To better identify the drug, users can enter the NSC and the CAS number for the compound.
	More detailed information about the therapy is gathered. The following fields have been added: age at treatment, gender, dosage, administrative route.
	The results of the experiment can be described in the biomarker and tumor response fields. 


- Microarray
	Micrroarray data are stored in MAGE-compliant caArray application instead of the Gene Expression Data Portal (GEDP).


- Images
	The text field for entering the staining method was replaced by a controlled vocabulary. 


- Xenograft
	Xenograft page was extended by the following fields: ATCC number, Cell amount, harvest date, graft type


- Model Availability
	Users can now enter information about the availability of the animal model from more sources as in caMOD 1.0. They can also indicate if the tool strains that were used to generate the model are available from one or more sources. The users can make multiple entries per model.
	


Administration

Users who have been assigned the roles of coordinator, screener, and editor will be presented with a to-do list of tasks when the access the Admin part after logging in.


Search

- Simple Search
	The simple search was extended by a keyword search option.

- Advanced Search
	The advanced search includes now a query option for drugs or compounds used in therapeutic experiments, an option to query for models that develop metastases, and a keyword search.

- Drug Screening 
	The user can query for results of drug tested in yeast strains, xenograft and allograft mouse models (titled for this purpose as in-vivo models), pre-clinical models, and humans. The tests in yeast and in-vivo models were performed by the Developmental Therapeutics Program of the National Cancer Institute. Information about pre-clinical models is retrieved from the models part of caMOD, and human data are retrieved via caBIO from clinical trials. 
		

- Search detail pages
	The therapeutic approaches pages includes information about drug screens in yeast and in-vivo, as well as clinical trials.

    5.0 Known Issues/Defects
================================================================
    
    1. Organ-specific preselection of diagnoses in the vocabulary trees is not available
    2. Users need to have a caArray user account in order to submit data to caArray, users need 
    to inform caMOD team if they would like to have experiments in caArray linked to their caMOD entries
    3. Genetic Description view screen does not include data for the following sections: Libraries and Tissues (from EST data) 
    or Protein Similarities (from UniGene).  caBio discontinued support for the Protein Similarities and the 
    performance for the Libraries and Tissues query did not meet minimum standards.  After meeting with
    the caBio team, it was concluded that the development team will need to eliminate lazy fetching for
    library and tissue attributes if we want to improve performance.
    
   
    Please report any defects found to application support.
