Configuring JBOSS to run CSM & Hibernate

Hibernate
1. Install Oracle 9i 
2. Create a database
3. Files to update - properties.xml
				     web/WEB-INF/classes/hibernate.properties

CSM
1. Download and install JBoss (we will be working with the default server configuration). 

2. The csmapi.jar is in /lib/csm currently being built and packaged into the WEB-INF\lib folder.

3. Create a directory (for local implementation) where all CSM config files pertaining to the app will reside (i.e. c:\camod) 

4. Copy csm_hibernate.cfg.xml from docs\CSM_config to directory created in Step 3. 

5. Update ApplicationSecurityConfig.xml file to identify the application context-name. This should 
   be 'camod'.  Also, update the path listed to csm_hibernate.cfg.xml. This file is in the docs\CSM_config directory.

6. Copy ApplicationSecurityConfig.xml from docs\CSM_config to the directory created in Step 3.

7. Update properties-service.xml. An example is located in the doc\CSM_config directory. This file
    needs to know the location of our ApplicationSecurityConfig.xml. Note: the slashes are reversed, use unix style / slashes.

8. Copy properties-service.xml to <<jboss-home>>/server/default/deploy/.

9. Finally, we need to provide the login information. This is done in the login-config.xml. This file
   is also in docs\CSM_config and you should be able to reuse it as-is. I'd recommend renaming the 
   existing file (i.e. login-config.xml.orig). It simply specifies the common security schema location and login parameters. 

10. Build the app. 

11. Deploy your war file into the <<jboss-home>>/server/default/deploy/ directory and start JBoss. 

12. Login.jsp uses LogonAction.java and LogonForm.java to authenticate the login. Test it out.



Problems you may run into:

1) Make sure in  properties-service.xml that the the gov.nih.nci.security.configFile property looks similiar to this. 
   Note the direction of the slashes, it won't work with \ slashes.

    <attribute name="Properties">
      gov.nih.nci.security.configFile=C:/Devtools/jboss-4.0.2/server/default/CSM/ApplicationSecurityConfig.xml
    </attribute>

2) hibernate2.1.7c.jar is required for any updating of User properties, roles, etc. hibernate3x.jar will not work!

3) mysql-connector-java-3.1.7-bin.jar is required in war for authentication to work
