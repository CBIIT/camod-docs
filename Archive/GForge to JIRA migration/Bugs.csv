See definition
Incidence is the number of new cases of a condition, symptom, death, or injury that arise during a specific period of time, such as a year. It is often expressed as a percentage of a population (e.g., 25% of American residents were diagnosed with the flu in 2002).

Incidence conveys the likelihood that an individual in that population will be affected by the condition.
