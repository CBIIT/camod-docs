2. Type in 'doxorubicin' for a Keyword Search.  Hit Keyword Search button.  See the 10 records found.
3. Go to Advanced Search again. Keep doxorubicin in Keyword field, but also search for a PI. Try Cory Abate-Shen, because I know we only have 2 models for her. Hit the Search button that belongs to Advanced Search, at the top of Advanced Search section.
4. Results appear to show a compound search, for doxorubicin and Cory Abate-Shen, but the 10 records returned are all the doxorubicin records."
