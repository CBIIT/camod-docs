<strong>Experimental Design</strong><blockquote>Stage2 experiments were performed at 5 doses, in duplicate. Doses used were 100 <font face="symbol">m</font>M, 33 <font face="symbol">m</font>M, 11 <font face="symbol">m</font>M, 3.7 <font face="symbol">m</font>M and 1.2 <font face="symbol">m</font>M. The data are derived from the fraction of growth of the yeast strain exposed to the compound relative to the growth of the same yeast strain treated with solvent only. In Stage2 experiments &quot;wild-type&quot; controls have been included. &quot;wt1&quot; serves as the control for the bub3, CLN2oe, mec2-1, rad14, rad18, rad50 and rad52 strains. &quot;wt2&quot; serves as the control for the mgt1, mlh1, rad50EPP+ and sgs1 strains.

In Stage2 experiments the strains were each mutant for a single target gene, as well as for 3 genes ( erg6, pdr1 &amp; pdr3) that increase yeast&lsquo;s sensitivity to drugs.
