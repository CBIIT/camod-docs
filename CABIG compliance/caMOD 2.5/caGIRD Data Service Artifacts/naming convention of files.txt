Naming convention of xmi files

Workflow:

1. caMOD 2.5 EAP exported to run in caAdapter
camod_pre_adapter.xmi 
- is the original EA Object Model file (2.5) with the Data Model (database schema imported) 

2.  The camod_pre_adapter.xmi file is loaded into caAdapter to link the OM Objects to DB Tables 
and the OM attributes to DB columns.
camod_post_adapter.xmi 
- is the EA Object Model file (2.5.1) after caAdapter adds tags and links data to objects

3.  The camod_post_adapter.xmi file is loaded back into EA to add Dependency Mappings before it
is export (round trip) for caCORE SDK 4.0
camod.xmi 
- is the xmi file run in caCORE SDK used to create the Data Source input file for caGRID (Introduce)
